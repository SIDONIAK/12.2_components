> A Design System Study

## About

This is a project for the Web Development course at the Minneapolis College of Art and Deisgn. The project was to dissect a well designed website, mine being the [Fresh Consulting](https://www.freshconsulting.com/), and then break it down into components, making a component library. From there, we were to rebuild the entire website from scratch, using the components from the library we made.
